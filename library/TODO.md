## To Do

- [ ] Improve configuration via factories so that it is not compulsory to send all possible properties in the configuration object
- [ ] Alpha network should not be used by default because hardcoded in the general Cerebrum factory
  - [ ] Hardcoded usage of Alpha network should happen if using a specific bootstrapping factory built around it
- [ ] Add new networks as wrappers around third party open source neural networks libraries
  - [ ] Add specific bootstraping factories around the new networks as wrappers
- [ ] Rename "mind" into "network" around the code
- [ ] Implement reactive communication bus into the Cerebrum so that networks can interact with each other using messages each one reference with the name of the network that generated it
- [ ] Enable storing/loading of data and configurations for a single network
  - [ ] Enable storing/loading of data and configurations for all networks in a Cerebrum
  - [ ] Enable storing/loading of data and configurations for all networks in a Brain
- [ ] Add examples that support 3D visualization of the network as well as realtime plotting of select neurons/synapses behavior
  - [ ] Add examples that support 3D visualization all networks in a Cerebrum as well as realtime plotting of select neurons/synapses behavior
  - [ ] Add examples that support 3D visualization all networks in a Brain as well as realtime plotting of select neurons/synapses behavior
- [ ] Add support for streams and promises to training/querying methods as alternatives to the callbacks
