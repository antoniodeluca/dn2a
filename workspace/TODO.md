## To Do

- [ ] Allow creation of training data for each neural network
- [ ] Allow independent training of each neural network
- [ ] Enable storing/loading of data and configurations for a single network
  - [ ] Enable storing/loading of data and configurations for all networks in a Cerebrum
  - [ ] Enable storing/loading of data and configurations for all networks in a Brain
- [ ] Add advanced visualization of the graph of neural networks using 2D pipelines or 3D
- [ ] Allow configuration of parameters for each network
- [ ] Add storing/loading of projects
- [ ] Allow visualization of the state of each single neuron/synapse or network
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline for PRs verification and NPM module publishing
- [ ] Add example Docker configuration

## In Progress

- [x] Allow to define a project with multiple networks connected as a graph  
      *Application is able to show a list of networks* - [@antoniodeluca](https://github.com/antoniodeluca) with PR [#146](https://github.com/antoniodeluca/dn2a/pull/146)  
- [x] Create a prototype of the full user interface together relative APIs and activable via feature flag

## Done

- [x] Refactoring client application toward clean architecture
